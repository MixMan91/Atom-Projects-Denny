List of know bugs:

Formatting. There is a problem with the way the format is set up on my imagining
as far as centering and lining things up the way I want them. To see this correctly
you either need to put your bowser at full screen or adjust the browser window until
it looks right. You know you have it when the there are two small images on the left
and right lined up on top of each other.

Issues:

1) The email button was supposed to be able to have boxes that ask for your name,
event date, and email address. This was then supposed to put this in a populated
email that would then just simply be ready to send to me. But I have been yet
unsuccessful in creating this to happen.

2) Formatting as mentioned above in the bugs. I would like to see this being
fixed to fit all formats it goes on.

ToDo's:

1) Make a working email retrieval system.
2) Figure out how to utilize my calendar function to work as tool to check
available dates.
3) Formatting, Formatting, Formatting.

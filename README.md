Here are some items that I have yet to figure out for my project:

1) I have yet to figure out how to utilize an API feature in my web page.
The thought pattern was to use it to drive a search engine for finding music
data. For now, I have only placed in a SEARCH Button that links to Discogs.com.
I realize that this is not the objective, but the thought was for my API to be
used in this fashion.

2) I was successful in creating a Entry Block System to request (Name, Event
  date, & email address), but when it comes to the information entered, it will
  not populate that entries into the email that pops up after sending. The Button
  does open up my email to send to me, but I need to figure out how to connect
  those entries in the email.

3) Lastly, for my date entry, you will notice I added a Calendar above the date
box, the idea was to have that function work inside of the data entry box marked
"date". But of course, I have no idea how to make that work.
